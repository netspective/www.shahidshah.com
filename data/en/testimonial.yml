      I had the pleasure of attending Shahid's social media webinar and found it
      to be very informative, full of great tips for next month's HIMMS. His
      direct style really makes you take a good look at where you stand to
      improve your messaging and how best to prioritize solving the customer's
      problems and see things from their perspective.

      Shahid is a man you can count on! When times get tough and you look around
      to see who will fight the fight with you, Shahid will be by your side. He
      is self motivated, extremely smart and capable of getting it done. He is a
      superb manager and also willing to roll up his sleeves to do it himself
      when that is the best solution. We can all learn a few things from
      Shahid!

      I met Shahid at the Dell Think Tank on Healthcare earlier this year. He
      was very knowledgeable about the economics behind HITECH and the
      widespread adoption of EMR technology, and how these fit within the
      regulatory framework. He obviously has a great deal of experience in the
      industry, and provides thought leadership. I look forward to working with
      Shahid in future projects and/or initiatives.

      Like Tim, I'm a health IT blogger and I read HIStalk because the writing
      is prescient, accurate, useful, and relevant. Getting healthcare
      technology content right and keeping it readable is really tough but
      somehow Tim makes it look so easy. As a fellow blogger I've often read
      articles on HIStalk which makes me say "gosh, I wish I wrote that!" I've
      read Tim and his publications from day 1, will continue to read them on my
      own, and will continue to recommend them highly to everyone else who wants
      intelligible advice on healthcare technology.

      As simplifyMD, a SaaS based EHR, moved from its seed startup to venture
      funded growth and scale phases we asked Stephen to lead us as our COO. His
      command of operations leadership skills has all the strengths of precision
      when required but with enough agility to make sure a modern SaaS based
      software platform like ours could succeed. He came in and systematized our
      delivery process, regularized customer acquisition steps, formalized our
      services, deepened our support team, and basically did everything that
      goes into making a software company successful. If you need a senior
      leader with significant health IT skills that knows how to get things
      done, Stephen's your man

      Susan is one of those rare individuals in business that just loves working
      with customers, especially physician offices and their staff. She was a
      big reason for the early success of simplifyMD and Susan was one of the
      main the reasons why customers loved the company. Susan's leadership on
      the product design, customer support, and especially training teams
      priceless.
