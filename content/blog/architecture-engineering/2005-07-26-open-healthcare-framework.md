The [Eclipse Open Healthcare Framework Project][1] was proposed back in June and seems to be a great undertaking. Although it is _going_ to do (assuming it succeeds) some of the same things that our open source [Medigy Platform][2] _already does_, perhaps there will be portions of the Eclipse project that we can use to replace or augment our Medigy Platform. If you&#8217;re looking for one or more frameworks for building EMR or other healthcare applications, it looks like you&#8217;ll have some choices in the next few years.
