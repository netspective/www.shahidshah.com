Microsoft recently released the [Enterprise Library for .NET Framework 2.0][1]. 

I continue to be impressed by Microsoft&#8217;s movement in the Enterprise components direction. While .NET still has a way to catch up to the Java camp in the open source community, Microsoft is (as usual) doing a great job supporting developers by giving out this stuff for free.

Here&#8217;s what Microsoft says is in EL 2.0:

>   * Caching Application Block. With this application block, developers can incorporate a local cache in their applications.
>   * Cryptography Application Block. With this application block, developers can incorporate hashing and symmetric encryption in their applications.
>   * Data Access Application Block. With this application block, developers can incorporate standard database functionality in their applications.
>   * Exception Handling Application Block. With this application block, developers and policy makers can create a consistent strategy for processing exceptions that occur throughout the architectural layers of enterprise applications.
>   * Logging Application Block. With this application block, developers can include standard logging functionality in their applications.
>   * Security Application Block. With this application block, developers can incorporate authorization and security caching functionality in their applications.
> 
> Enterprise Library also includes a set of core functions, including configuration, instrumentation, and object builder services. These functions are used by all other application blocks.
