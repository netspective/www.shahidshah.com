These days my consulting work is taking me more and more into the area of _Knowlege Modeling_ (see my blog from a few days ago). After my clients read that blog additional questions came up and two of the most prevalent were &#8220;what the heck is an ontology?&#8221; and &#8220;ok, so how do I develop an ontology?&#8221; I&#8217;ve been working on some materials for training and mentoring in the area of knowlege modeling myself but a couple of great resources are:

  * Ontology Engineering [PowerPoint presentation][1]. That site is sometimes hard to reach so the PowerPoint is available [here][2], too.
  * Ontology Development 101 in [PDF][3] and [HTML][4].
