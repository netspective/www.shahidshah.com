One of the most hardest problems all engineers have to deal with is the appropriate, accurate, and timely documentation of their code. I just ran across a new tool called [Documentation Enhancer for Java][1] that adds some real value to JavaDoc generated API documentation by adding semantic information. The utility adds information about the behavior of classes to their Javadocs based on the actual method implementations and not just the method signatures. This allows for the tool to automatically add call-graph information and reference data about callers and callees. Definitely worth checking out.
