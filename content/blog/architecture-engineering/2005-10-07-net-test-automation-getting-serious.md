As a consultant with clients that are on both the .NET and Java platforms (and many other legacy ones, too) I follow Microsoft&#8217;s progress closely. Over the past few years the test automation and test early (unit testing, JUnit, etc) thought leaders have made significant progress on the Java platform. The tools are solid, IDE support is deep, and it&#8217;s almost taken for granted. Although open source tools like NUnit have been available for the Visual Studio IDE, Microsoft itself was a little slow to support integrated and automated unit testing. Now, however, in Visual Studio 2005 they have learned from everyone else and have done a great job of integrating code quality via test automation directly into the IDE. Check out the following articles to see how far they&#8217;ve come and for a peek at where other IDE vendors will need to go to keep up:

  * [General Code Unit Testing][1]
  * [Web/Presentation Testing][2]
