In case you haven&#8217;t seen it already, the OMB&#8217;s new [Federal Transition Framework][1] (FTF) is an excellent approach to creating architecture governance documentation. I&#8217;ve been working with federal agencies on various enterprrise architecture (EA) initiatives for several years now and one of the problems we&#8217;ve always had has been communicating what the initiatives are, why they are important, how strategic or tactical they are, how they should be scheduled, etc.

I&#8217;ve also been working with commercial firms trying to do similar architecture governance and they&#8217;ve faced the same kinds of problems of documenting the strategy. 

The OMB&#8217;s new FTF is a good source for reviewing how to take enterprise-wide initiatives, document them, share the knowledge, and establish a process by which progress can be tracked.

Definitely worth taking a look.
