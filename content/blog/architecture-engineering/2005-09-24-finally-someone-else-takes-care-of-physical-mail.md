For those of us that are tired of spam in our snail mail and haven&#8217;t quite found the equivalent of a physical bayesian filter for their real postal mail, take a look at [Remote Control Mail][1]. I found their idea of a permanent (snail) mail address where they gather all of your incoming mail, scan (the outside), notify you of its existence (with the outside scan), scan the inside if you like (for a fee), and then either forward it to you or shred it, truly astounding. This is one of those services you didn&#8217;t really know you need until someone comes up with it and then you say &#8220;hey, I could use that!&#8221; Worth checking out, especially for those on the move or own their own small businesses.
