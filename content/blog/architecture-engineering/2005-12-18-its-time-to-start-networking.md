I interviewed Eric Spiegel and blogged about him a couple of weeks ago. He&#8217;s written a great piece recently called _[It&#8217;s Time to Start Networking][1]_.

Here&#8217;s the introduction:

> First let me start off with the obvious, considering my target audience. The networking I&#8217;m going to write about has nothing to do with Ethernet or 802.11 Wi-Fi standards. The topic of this article is about the type of networking IT professionals fear the most &#8212; person-to-person networking.
