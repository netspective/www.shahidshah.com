If you spend as much time on the Internet as I do you probably spend much of time going from website to website tracking and reading interesting articles. After getting sick of going to almost a dozen or more sites per day just trying to stay up on technology and other news, I got a copy of the new [JetBrains OMEA Reader][1] application. In one easy to use window I now get all my news hourly with filtering and aggregation. There&#8217;s a professional and a &#8220;reader&#8221; (free) version of OMEA but I find the free one gives me everything I need to save time. Give it a shot and you can stay up to date with less hassle.
