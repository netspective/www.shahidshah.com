This week I was in San Diego attending JavaPro Live! 2005. I found the conference cozy (small :-)), informative, and for the most part useful. One of the highlights of my trip (aside from attending with a client of mine, Mr. John Dougherty, another very bright Architect) was being able to spend a few &#8220;off&#8221; hours with Michael Keith, the co-specification lead for the EJB 3.0 JSR (220). I found Mike to be thoughtful, articulate, and quite knowledgable of the persistence space. His background was with TopLink and JDO and he brings a lot of credibility to the JSR 220 working group. Unlike some members of other JSRs I&#8217;ve talke with in the past, he was not arrogant and didn&#8217;t believe that his little corner of the universe knew everything there was to know. I&#8217;ve not been a big fan of EJB 1.x through 2.x for many technical reasons and its lack of simplicity but now that I&#8217;ve worked with the EJB 3.0 draft (writing real code) for almost 6 months I find it quite usable and a great alternative to other distributed object programming models. And, after meeting Mike Keith, I think the spec is in very good hands and I have very hopes for EJB 3.0 when it hits the streets.
