Very few of us deal with the kinds of problems that engineers at NASA face &#8212; except for perhaps other engineers working in safety critical fields like avionics and medical devices. I live nearby NASA&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), which is home to one of the most advanced software engineering labs in the world. As you can imagine, they take their engineering processes very seriously so when they put together an event open to the public I usually attend.

Recently they put together a talk on _Independent Verification and Validation: The NASA Approach_. This presentation described how verification and validation is executed within NASA. It &#8220;described what IV&V is and what it is not, the process that NASA uses to determine what projects the IV&V Program will work with, the approach that the IV&V Program takes to planning the tasks to be executed and how those tasks are executed.&#8221;
