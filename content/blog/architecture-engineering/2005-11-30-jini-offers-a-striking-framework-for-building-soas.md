When I did some architecture work for NIH a couple of years back we put Sun&#8217;s Jini technology on the evaluation shortlist. I&#8217;d almost forgotten about it until I read this JavaPro _[Jini at Your Service][1]_ article. It&#8217;s worth reading, especially with everyone working on SOA stuff these days.
