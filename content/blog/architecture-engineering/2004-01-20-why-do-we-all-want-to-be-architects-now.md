I&#8217;ve noticed that the term software architect, a term I use quite often to describe myself, is in vogue these days. It&#8217;s interesting to hear that many developers who used to call themselves senior software engineers are doing the same thing that I&#8217;m doing &#8212; starting to use the term Software Architect. Even Bill Gates now has the title &#8220;Chairman and Chief Software Architect&#8221; at Microsoft! What&#8217;s the difference between a software engineer and a systems/software architect?

In software now there&#8217;s even a specialty of &#8220;Enterprise Architect&#8221; versus &#8220;Software Architect&#8221;. We all know precisely what an architect and engineer does in the physical world of construction but what about the logical electronic world of software? 

I was approached by Amazon.com recently to join their team and found it interesting that they said &#8220;We have no &#8216;architects&#8217; versus &#8216;implementors&#8217;, everyone does everything from requirements and design through rollout.&#8221; So does that imply that architects don&#8217;t really implement anything? Is software architectue just an intellectual exercise?

I have been coding for about 15 years and still code many hours a week (mainly Java, Perl, Ruby, and C#). In my line of work (J2EE development) I have seen many architects that don&#8217;t know how to code what they &#8220;architect&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s a good idea &#8212; hiring architects that can&#8217;t code (even a bit of scripting or basic prototyping is useful). I saw someone say on a website a while back &#8220;an architect that can not code is like a composer that plays no instrument.&#8221; But, is that accurate? Maybe not.

To be fair to all the systems and software architects out there &#8212; nobody would expect a building architect do be a carpenter &#8212; and perhaps we shouldn&#8217;t expect software architects to carry out their plans (simply oversee them). I spend most of my time talking with senior management, executives, and end users that tell me what their systems want to do and then I create systems plans such servers, network, data centers, and the like to carry out the requirements. Code and software construction (as Stevel McConnell puts it) seems to be a smaller and smaller part of my job (to my dismay because I love to code).

Is systems architecture versus software architecture a meaningful distinction? Perhaps systems architects need to be like traditional building architects &#8212; be able to take requirements from customers, create a vision, and lay out the plans for implementing the vision in a timely manner. Systems architects may not need to be coders but software architects probably do.
