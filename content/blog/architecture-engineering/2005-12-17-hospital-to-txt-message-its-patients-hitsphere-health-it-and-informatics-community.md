Victor at HITSphere reports [Hospital to txt message its patients][1]. This is a great example of how simple tools like using email and now text messaging can save costs without introducing much new IT infrastructure. Of course, in the USA we&#8217;re still charged for text messages on our mobiles phones but overseas they&#8217;re usually free (and consequently in heavier use).
