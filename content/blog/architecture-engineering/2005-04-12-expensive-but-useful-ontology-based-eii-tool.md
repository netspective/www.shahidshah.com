Today I attended a presentation on PiiE by [Digital Harbor][1] which seems like a great tool to build Enterprise Information Integration (EII) solutions. EII tools address the data access challenges that arise from data heterogeneity (fancy words for &#8220;lots of databases&#8221;). EII tools of course pull and combine data from multiple systems on the fly and potentially create a virtual data warehouse (without requiring ETL). What I found nice about the PiiE is that its strong integration of an ontology builder and an excellent Java-based smart client. If you&#8217;re looking for data federation based on ontologies where the end user can then drive their own queries, reports, and &#8220;smart apps&#8221; definitely check out PiiE. It&#8217;s a tad expensive but for some uses it may actually save money.
