The Microsoft MVP Architect&#8217;s mailing list today had a pleasant surprise: [Fred Chong&#8217;s WebBlog : SaaS is a journey, walk with us][1].

Check out the article if you&#8217;re at all involved in SaaS. Here&#8217;s how he started:

> Looking through the lens of an architect, architecting software as a service is an area sorely in need of better guidance. Of the companies I have spoken to, some have redelivered classic client-server applications using technology similar to terminal server so that they can expedite the time-to-market, only to run into scalability issues when the market demand for their software service takes off; some have chosen to put all their customers data in one database, with no upfront consideration for data performance and regulatory compliance issues; a few have attempted to solve per tenant data model extensions issues with many battle scars to prove apparent intractability of the perfect solution

> This is great. The above are all reasons why I have a day job

> Ive been spending a lot of time looking into how my team can help lower the bar for software vendors to deliver software as a service. Im a fan of SaaS, because I believe this software delivery mechanism changes the economics of the software industry in a way that allows online information and computing to be accessible to many more people in emerging markets such as India and China. This is a topic that warrants a separate posting a different time. For now, I want to highlight what Microsoft is bringing to the table in terms of SaaS architecture guidance.
