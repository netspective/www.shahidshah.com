Ron Jacobs talks about [Project &#8220;Noodle&#8221;][1], a new Microsoft project designed to help people become architects. There&#8217;s a PowerPoint presentation called [_Architects and the Architecture of Software_][2] that&#8217;s a pretty nice intro and I&#8217;ll try and keep an eye on the project to see how it progresses and is able to meet its goal.
