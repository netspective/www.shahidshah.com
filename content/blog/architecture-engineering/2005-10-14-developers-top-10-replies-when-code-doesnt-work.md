I loved the list of top 10 developer excuses that [Enrique][1] posted on his blog. 

> 10. &#8216;That&#8217;s weird&#8230;&#8217;
  
> 9. &#8216;It&#8217;s never done that before.&#8217;
  
> 8. &#8216;It worked yesterday.&#8217;
  
> 7. &#8216;You must have the wrong version.&#8217;
  
> 6. &#8216;It works, but it hasn&#8217;t been tested.&#8217;
  
> 5. &#8216;Somebody must have changed my code.&#8217;
  
> 4. &#8216;Did you check for a virus?&#8217;
  
> 3. &#8216;Where were you when the program blew up?&#8217;
  
> 2. &#8216;Why do you want to do it that way?&#8217;
  
> 1. &#8216;I thought I fixed that.&#8217;
