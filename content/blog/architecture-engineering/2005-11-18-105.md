Last night I presented my briefing on hype, pitfalls, and opportunities associated with Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to the Nothern Virginia Chapter of the IEEE Computer Society. Many people asked for a copy of the briefing/presentation so here it is:

_[Enabling the Service Oriented Enterprise][1] &#8211; Overcoming the hype, misconceptions, and pitfalls of SOA_

If you attended the meeting last night, please feel free to leave me comments on what you liked, what you didn&#8217;t like, and whether it was helpful.

Enjoy!
