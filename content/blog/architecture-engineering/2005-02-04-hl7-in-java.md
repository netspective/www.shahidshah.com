Much of my consulting work happens to be in the healthcare industry so HL7 is a major standard that I have to deal with. I just ran across this [great set of HL7 utilities][1], all written in Java. Mike&#8217;s written some good code to parse and browse, send/receive messages, and create reports based on HL7 data. It&#8217;s worth checking out.
