As an architect and developer I have many open source (and commercial) tools at my disposal for _creating_ software but I&#8217;ve had a hard time finding quality open source (or even commercial) projects for managing my projects. I just started a large-scale service oriented medical informatics project and have had to cobble together solutions for the following goals: project comprehension, team communication, and artifacts management. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done so far&#8230;

  * We need to create an ultra-modern and great looking marketing website. We&#8217;ve outsourced this off-shore as an experiment and have chosen [Basecamp][1] to manage the project. Basecamp has been nice but it&#8217;s designed for general project management (and Basecamp was written by a design firm) so it&#8217;s not great for software development. I took a look at [Rally][2] as well but they made it very hard to try out the product and it&#8217;s _very_ expensive for what I think it does. The Rally guys just raised millions in venture capital so they need to make sure they charge high prices to return money to their investors. I took a look at [Trac][3], too, and found it quite nice but they only support SubVersion while I&#8217;m still using CVS. Of course, i made the requisite stop at at Atlassian who make Jira and Confluence but those are not integrated enough for me to pay the money.
  * We need an ultra-modern and highly usable graphic design in the user interface of the application itself. We&#8217;re still looking for a design firm to help us here but I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any specific software that&#8217;s going to help here. Once the design is done we&#8217;ll be using our own inhouse [Sparx][4] framework to write the code.
  * We need to create an online demo that shows every feature of our product &#8212; one in an interactive manner and another in movie format for easier viewing. We&#8217;re managing the project in Basecamp but the actual tool we&#8217;re currently using is undecided. 
  * We need a continuous integration tool to make sure all the various software components we&#8217;re creating remain stable and tested throughout the project. We have chosen and installed [LuntBuild 1.2][5] beta and are very happy with it. It&#8217;s easy to use, flexible, and quite powerful at the same time. Of course, the builds have JUnit integrated.
  * We needed code coverage instrumentation to ensure that our unit testing provides enough coverage. We&#8217;re using Emma, which I referred to in a blog a few months back. We&#8217;ve integrated it into LuntBuild and it&#8217;s working like a charm &#8212; not quite as glossy as Clover but Emma is plenty powerful and it&#8217;s free.
  * For defect tracking I&#8217;m sticking with Bugzilla for now.
