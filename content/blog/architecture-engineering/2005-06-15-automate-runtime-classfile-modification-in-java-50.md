I ran across [this great article][1] that demonstrates how to change Java classes on the fly (at load time). The article discusses how to automatically implement the useful but difficult to maintain toString() methods we&#8217;re all familiar with but has given me dozens of new ideas for my own implementations. Worth checking out indeed.
