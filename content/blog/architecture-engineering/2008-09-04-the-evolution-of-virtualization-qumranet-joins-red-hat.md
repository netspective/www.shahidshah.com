I saw this <a href="http://www.redhat.com/promo/qumranet/" target="_blank">press release</a> that caught my eye (thanks, Rich):

> Red Hat today announced the acquisition of Qumranet, Inc. The acquisition includes Qumranet&#8217;s virtualization solutions, including its KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) platform and SolidICE offering, a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), which together present a comprehensive virtualization platform for enterprise customers. In addition, in connection with the deal, Qumranet&#8217;s talented team of professionals that develop, test and support Qumranet solutions, and its leaders of the open source community KVM project, will join Red Hat.

This is very good news for the free (built-in an OS) virtualization market.
