Since most of us in IT spend at least part of our time combining and moving data to and from multiple databases, it might be worth taking a look at an open source toolkit called [Hydrate][1] that eases the process. From their description:

> Hydrate is a Java tool that provides for fast efficient and error-free transformation of data between three different representations: relational databases, objects in an object-oriented programming language and extended markup language (XML).
