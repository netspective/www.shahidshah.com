Saw a great article on running Apache [Ant][1] without putting the entire build file in XML. Why would you want to do this? Read [this][2]. It talks about how to &#8220;employ Ant programmatically in Java code without the constraints of XML for easier customization.&#8221; If you like this model of writing Ant tasks without XML, but don&#8217;t like the verbosity of Java for doing so, take a look at the [Groovy][3] scripting language which allows Ant build files to be written in Groovy.
