I am the founder and CEO of [Netspective Communications LLC](http://www.netspective.com) and an expert software engineer, systems architect, and technology evangelist. This blog is about my personal opinions on software development, the state of software engineering practice, and other things I find interesting.

In my [professional life](http://shahid.shah.org/resume/) I have held the roles of VP of Technology, CTO, Chief Software Architect, or Lead Engineer at large enterprises for the past 8 years and have more than 13 years of total IT experience. My key technology expertise areas are Distributed Object Services, Web Services, Enterprise Application Integration, Java, J2EE, Enterprise JavaBeans, .NET, CORBA, SOAP, XML, UML, and Object- and Aspect-Oriented Software Development. I also have a great deal of experience in all areas of enterprise-level software development methodologies such as RUP and CMM and agile methodologies such as eXtreme Programming (XP), including work in regulated environments such as FDA, Pharma, and DOD.

I have a Master&#8217;s degree (M.Sc.) in Technology Management from the University of Maryland and a bachelor&#8217;s degree (B.Sc.) in Computer Science from The Pennsylvania State University.

In my spare time I serve as the Chairman of the [IEEE Computer Society&#8217;s Northern Virginia Chapter](http://www.cigital.com/ieee) where I am responsible for holding technical talks and chapter activities for several thousand members in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area. I also give lectures and talks on a variety of software-related topics all over the country.

I live in Silver Spring, Maryland (a suburb of Washington, D.C.) with my lovely wife Naghma, my resourceful son Amir, and my beautiful twin daughters Aliyah and Asma.
