I just ran across [this link][1] that provides a list of existing open source _Electronic Medical Records_ (EMR) solutions. I&#8217;ve been working off and on in this space for almost 8 years but the field just doesn&#8217;t seem to mature. None of the healthcare vertical open sources solutions seem to have the kind of quality we&#8217;ve come to expect from the horizontal applications and technology space (like Apache web server or Linux operating system).
