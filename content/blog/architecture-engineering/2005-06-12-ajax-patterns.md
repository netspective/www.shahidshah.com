I&#8217;ve been doing [AJAX][1] programming for several years (ever since I learned about XMLHttpRequest) but of course it didn&#8217;t have a cool name before. Many of the patterns I&#8217;ve used have not been cataloged before but I was delighted to run across [this site][2] that speaks specifically to AJAX Patterns. My favorite page is on [AJAX Frameworks][3] because even though I&#8217;ve built thousands of lines of JavaScript code to support my AJAX needs many of the frameworks on that page seem more reusable so I&#8217;ll be switching out some of my old code and replace it with one or more of the newer ones.
