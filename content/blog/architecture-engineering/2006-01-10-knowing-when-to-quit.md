As a serial entrepreneur, I found this _[Knowing When to Quit][1]_ very useful. I advise new startups regularly and sometimes I give them this same speech that Jim wrote about:

> If you still can&#8217;t raise the money you need to fund your business, it&#8217;s time to decide if you should stay in the game or throw in the towel. 

Jim&#8217;s advice is useful not only for entreprenuers but also for intrapreneurs (people starting projects within their own firms).
