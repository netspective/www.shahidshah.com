I&#8217;ve been searching for a nice music player that would connect to my existing tunes on my PC and play them wirelessly. I&#8217;ve seen many offered but they all look like computer devices and the room I want to put the player in doesn&#8217;t have a computer so I wanted something that looked nice (not like a computer device). I came across the [Roku][1] and will be trying it out shortly. It doesn&#8217;t look like a computing device but does act like one.
