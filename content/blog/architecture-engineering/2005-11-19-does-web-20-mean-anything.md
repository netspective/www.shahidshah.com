Paul&#8217;s a great writer and he&#8217;s just posted a grea piece on [Web 2.0][1]. Some of my favorite snippets:

> The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows during the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot startup. There was that same odd atmosphere created by a large number of people determined not to miss out. Miss out on what? They didn&#8217;t know. Whatever was going to happen&#8211; whatever Web 2.0 turned out to be.
> 
> I wouldn&#8217;t quite call it &#8220;Bubble 2.0&#8221; just because VCs are eager to invest again. The Internet is a genuinely big deal. The bust was as much an overreaction as the boom. It&#8217;s to be expected that once we started to pull out of the bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there was in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.
