If you haven&#8217;t heard already, you should mosey on down to [this page][1] to see the new features. FreeMarker is my favorite Java-based templating engine and IMHO easily beats out engines like JSP, Velocity, or WebMacro. It&#8217;s got a great design and it&#8217;s a cinch to integrate into any Java application. Of course my [framework][2] has built-in support for FreeMarker, along with JSP, and we&#8217;ll be releasing our next version of the NEFS with the latest FreeMarker version.
