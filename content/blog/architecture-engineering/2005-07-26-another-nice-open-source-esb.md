I&#8217;ve been talking to customers for months about Mule, one of the first open source Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) implementations. I just ran across [ServiceMix][1] which is also an open source ESB built around JBI (JSR 208) principles, semantics and APIs. According to the ServiceMix website, &#8220;ServiceMix is lightweight and easily embeddable, has integrated Spring support and can be ran at the edge of the network (inside a client or server), as a standalone ESB provider or as a service within another ESB. You can use ServiceMix in Java SE or a Java EE application server.&#8221; Definitely worth checking out.
