Lee Gomes, of the Wall Stree Journal, recently wrote _[The Men Who Came To Dinner, and What They Said About Email][1]_. It&#8217;s an interesting discussion with the heads of the GYM (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft) email groups about how each one approaches email, why they got into the space, and how users benefit from their respective email systems. I would have liked to have been invited to that dinner!
