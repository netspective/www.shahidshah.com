An interesting alternative to ORMs is presented at DevX.com in their _[Use Stored Procedures for Java Persistence][1]_ article. Worth chewing on.

By the way, I&#8217;m still a big fan of ORMs and, in particular, EJB3. And while I believe in stored procs and use them heavily, they are not for everyone and you need a solid data architect and application architect to agree on a good design solution.
