Those of us involved in the healthcare IT (HIT) market may want to keep an eye on these [new awards][1] and other RFIs related to it. According to Government Computer News (GCN):

> The Health and Human Services Department will award contracts next week in the next step in its efforts to pave the way for adoption of health IT. The contracts are intended to develop standards harmonization, standards compliance certification and assessments of the variations in state privacy laws.
