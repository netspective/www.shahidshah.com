Given that all the major players like IBM and BEA are looking to make ESB announcement these days, it&#8217;s good to remember that you can&#8217;t just take an older product and just throw in a few bells and whistles and then relabel it as an ESB. If you&#8217;re interested in the &#8220;pure play&#8221; ESBs take a look at this [article at Infoworld.com][1] describing the ESB playing field.
