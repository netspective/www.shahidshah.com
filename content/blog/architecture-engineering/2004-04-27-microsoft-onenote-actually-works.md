As a person that spends equal time with business and technology issues I take lots of notes and have tried my share of &#8220;note taking&#8221; software. However, I never spent more than a few weeks on any particular note taker or outliner software. That was true until I tried Microsoft OneNote. I&#8217;ve been sticking with it because it just works &#8212; it captures all my thoughts, lets me drag and drop images from the web, it lets me do research for my writing (both code and papers), and puts it all together in a way that keeps my desk less cluttered. If you&#8217;ve been looking for a note taking application, give OneNote a try &#8212; it might change your mind, too.
