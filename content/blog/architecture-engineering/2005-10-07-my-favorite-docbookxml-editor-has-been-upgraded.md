My favorite DocBook editor, [XMLMind XML Editor (XXE)][1] is now at version 3.0. If you&#8217;ve not tried it before, check it out since it&#8217;s got a free _standard edition_ and then a more powerful professional version. If you&#8217;re an ISV with your own special XML formats, the XXE also comes in an OEM flavor that lets you create your own XML editor for your special requirements.
