More info: The typical scientist, engineer or technologist brings the following skills to managerial duties:

* Exceptional problem solving skills
  
* Exceptional self-improvement skills
  
* Exceptional system modeling skills

The typical manager has to be able to:

* Understand his or her business environment
  
* Build key relationship networks
  
* Build successful teams
  
* Exploit business opportunities and problems (yes, both)

This seminar will help you make this transition successfully. The
  
participants will receive a training manual. This seminar is offered through Washington Academy of Sciences, of which IEEE Northern Virginia and Washington Sections are affiliates.
