If you&#8217;re looking to enable a service-oriented healthcare architecture you&#8217;re going to need some good DTDs and XSDs (XML Schemas) for managing patient data. [This link][1] contains information about the ASTN DTDs for exchanging patient data. The HL7 group also has their own [Clinical Document Architecture][2].
