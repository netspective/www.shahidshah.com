I just discovered the [TargetProcess][1] web based project management tool. It&#8217;s described as an &#8220;Agile Project Management System&#8221; and states that &#8220;The Primary Goal of TargetProcess system is extremely clear ? fast feedback about project state.&#8221; It&#8217;s not as feature-rich as VersionOne.net or other similar tools but TargetProcess is free and easy to use.
