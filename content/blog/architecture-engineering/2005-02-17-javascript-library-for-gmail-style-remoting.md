I just ran across the [DWR library][1] that lets you call Java code asynchronously through Javascript without reloading a webpage. The &#8220;Direct Web Remoting&#8221; library allows you to easily call server-side Java POJOs through Javascript remoting on web browsers. Techniques like this are used by GMail and other &#8220;interactive&#8221; web applications to provide rich client functionality on normal browsers.
