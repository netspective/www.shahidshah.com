I&#8217;ve noticed that most of my clients have finally been convinced that unit testing and regular automated acceptance testing is a &#8220;good thing.&#8221; However, I&#8217;ve noticed that load/stress testing, while moving up in importance, still has a long way to go. Even those doing load testing, though, forget to do proper network simulation to make sure that their tests will valid with &#8220;real world&#8221; network traffic.

So, the simple advice is to be sure to use network traffic generators and network load simulators when testing your software. A good option is something like [Simena][1]. It&#8217;s not expensive and works well.
