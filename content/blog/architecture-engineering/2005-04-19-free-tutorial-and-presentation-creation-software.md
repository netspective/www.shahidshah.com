If you ever write software documentation such as tutorials or create demos of your software, you know you need &#8220;screen capture&#8221; software to take snapshots of screens. What you may find more useful is &#8220;screen motion capture&#8221; software that can capture full interactions of software in an animated format. Check out [Wink][1], which produces Flash animations out of your screen motion captures easily and for free.
