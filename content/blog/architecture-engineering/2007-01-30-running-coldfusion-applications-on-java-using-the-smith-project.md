I&#8217;ve written thousands of lines of ColdFusion in my web-career (the last line being around 2001) and I was always impressed by CF&#8217;s capabilities. I just ran across this new freeware (not open source yet, though) project that allows ColdFusion to run on Java without paying anything for a CF server. Seems very cool.

[Check out the&nbsp;Smith project][1]:

> Smith is a freeware, cross-platform ColdFusion engine, written entirely in Java. Running on the top of _Java Runtime Environment_ and _Java Servlet Container_, it can be virtually deployed on any operating system and work with any web server. Smith represents lightweight, yet reliable alternative to the existing ColdFusion servers. It supports most important CF features (see [Features][2]) and already drives several large ColdFusion applications. 
> 
> Deeply integrated in J2EE, Smith works as part of ordinary Java Web application and can easily be used together with servlets and JSPs. The server behaviour is easily configurable through the simple Web interface where database connections, debugging options, server mappings and more can be set. 
> 
> Smith is freeware software, which means that it comes with permission for anyone to use, copy, and distribute it. It is also being seriously considered to open-source it. 
> 
> [Download][3] and try fully functional version of the Smith engine.
