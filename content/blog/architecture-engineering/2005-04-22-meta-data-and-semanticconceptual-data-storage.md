Check out [Kowari][1], an open source database specifically designed to store knowlege-type semantic, conceptual, or meta-data. Instead of being built on top of a relational database designed for loading small amounts of larger data, the Kowari authors have designed their storage managers to hold small data with lots of relationships and short queries. It&#8217;s worth looking at.
