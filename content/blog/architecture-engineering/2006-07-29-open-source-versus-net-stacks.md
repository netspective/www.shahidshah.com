eWeek did a [decent review][1] of open source (including Java) versus .NET &#8220;stacks&#8221; a few weeks ago. While the review wasn&#8217;t as thorough as I would have liked, the conclusions will let each side to walk away. And, it demonstrates one of the points I&#8217;ve been making for years: that open source stacks on a Windows platform are a winning combination. I&#8217;m a huge fan of Linux but we shouldn&#8217;t drop Windows everytime we think of open source &#8212; there&#8217;s just as much use and benefits of an open source stack on WinTel as any other platform.
