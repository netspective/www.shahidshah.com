I spoke with the BizDev manager of [Fortis TCS][1] today. They are an interesting company that focuses on the tax side of technology. That is, if you spend money on R&D and would like to get tax credits (refunds of what you&#8217;ve already paid in taxes) then they&#8217;re a group you should get to know. 

Fortis comes in and talks with you for 30 to 60 minutes and can then give you an idea of how much money you might be able to get back from the government in the form of tax refunds based on R&D expenditures. They also do similar work with export expenses &#8212; meaning you can get tax credits if you do exports. The idea is worth looking at because if you invest in product R&D you can get cash back from the government. And, who wouldn&#8217;t want that?
