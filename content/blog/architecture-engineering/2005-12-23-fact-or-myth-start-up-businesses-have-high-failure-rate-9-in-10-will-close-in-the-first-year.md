[Balanko-Dickson reports][1]:

> There is a myth from the 1990s that stated 9 out of 10 businesses close in their first year. The US Small Business Administration still gets calls every year from people looking for the unknown source of the 9 out of 10 sound bite. The myth persists partly due to a widely held belief that business closure is always considered a negative event.
> 
> Dun & Bradstreet (D & B) data from the same period shows a much different picture:
> 
> * 76 percent of new businesses were open after two years.
      
> * 47 percent after four years.
      
> * 38 percent after six years.
> 
> So why does the myth flourish?
> 
> Because it is generally believed that new businesses have high failure rates based upon a widely held but unsubstantiated belief that new firm closure rates are high and that a closure is a negative outcome.
