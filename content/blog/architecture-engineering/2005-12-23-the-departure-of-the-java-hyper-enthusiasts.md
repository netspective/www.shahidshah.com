Bruce Eckel, author and Java pundit, writes about the  [departure of the hyper-enthusiasts][1]. He says, &#8220;the Java hyper-enthusiasts have left the building, leaving a significant contingent of Java programmers behind, blinking in the bright lights without the constant drumbeat of boosterism.&#8221; He goes on to write:

> Where did the hyper-enthusiasts go? To Ruby, apparently. This is chronicled in Bruce Tate&#8217;s book &#8220;Beyond Java,&#8221; which should probably be titled &#8220;Why Ruby is Better than Java.&#8221; The book is roughly edited; you&#8217;ll find yourself thinking &#8220;haven&#8217;t I read this paragraph before?&#8221; in any number of places, but that&#8217;s a disappointing experience I&#8217;ve had with several O&#8217;Reilly books of late.

> In many places he plays fast and loose, and almost at the end of the book he declares that he doesn&#8217;t have time to learn these other languages in any depth &#8212; although he has no trouble condemning the same languages in his rush to Ruby. Such a statement should be in the first paragraph of the book: &#8220;I&#8217;ve decided that I love Ruby, so I will condemn other languages without fully understanding them&#8221; (in one sentence repeated in a number of places in the book, for example, he declares that C# is no more than a clone of Java).

> I&#8217;ve been on the rollercoaster of language-love myself in the past and have made similar mistakes; one error in particular was dismissing Python&#8217;s scoping-by-indentation when I first saw it (months later realizing that we always indicate scoping by indentation anyway, even when we have curly braces available). Now I try to investigate and support my ideas about these things more thoroughly. It takes a lot more time and effort to do so, but it also leaves a more lasting impression. 

Well worth reading.
