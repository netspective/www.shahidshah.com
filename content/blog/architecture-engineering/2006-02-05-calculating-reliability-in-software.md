My friend Andy Glover (finally!) started his blog and he&#8217;s got a great first article on [software reliability][1]. He&#8217;s already a published author and writes for online magazines but as an expert in software quality it&#8217;s great to have him write regularly on his blog so that time between articles is reduced.
