I just ran across [Surrogate][1], a great little library that really puts AOP (aspect oriented programming, something I&#8217;ve been training clients on for some time) to excellent use. As a complement to Junit and a really great implementation of the mock objects pattern, Surrogate can help achieve ~100% code coverage by helping you mock out even Java system libraries (where tests might be time-dependent or have external dependencies in commercial libraries that you don&#8217;t have source for).
