I just discovered a neat little free utility called [Rainlendar][1] that can read my Microsoft Outlook calendar and put a {{popup rainlendar.gif rainlendar 377&#215;174}}slick transparent window</A> on my desktop that shows my schedule. I&#8217;ve been looking for a utility like this for a while and this one&#8217;s perfect because it installed in about 30 seconds, read my information right from outlook, and keeps it synchronized; now i don&#8217;t have to open up Outlook all the time just confirm my schedule. Rainlendar also works without Outlook but I haven&#8217;t tried out that feature. It manages to-do lists and notes as well.
