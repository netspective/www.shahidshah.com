My friend Andy Glover [recently interviewed Paul Duval][1], co-author of an upcoming book entitled &#8220;Continuous Integration: Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk&#8221; and a frequent No Fluff Just Stuff speaker. It&#8217;s a good interview about CI in general and how it can improve the software development process and ultimately help create better software.
