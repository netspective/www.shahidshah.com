A friend of mine asked me for some suggestions for tools that allow caching content that was generated through some expensive process. I&#8217;ve had good success with OSCache but offered him this list of open source projects to check out:

  * [SwarmCache (cluster-aware caching)][1]
  * [OSCache][2]
  * [EHCache (used in Spring, too)][3]
  * [JBossCache][3]
  * [JCS (Java Caching System)][4]
  * [WhirlyCache][5]

Also look at at [Cache Providers][6], it summarize _some_ of the differences between these cache providers.
