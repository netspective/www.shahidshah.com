[SchemaSpy][1], a graphical database schema documentation tool, was recently upgraded. I&#8217;ve [blogged about it before][2] and thought it was great. It&#8217;s now even better. It&#8217;s written in Java but can create offline HTML browsable documentation for any database with a JDBC driver (meaning it&#8217;s great for Java, Ruby, .NET, etc.)
