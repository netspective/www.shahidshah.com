Just ran across another open source build management tool called [LuntBuild][1]. Seems like it&#8217;s similar to AntHill and CruiseControl but somewhat easier to use as is doesn&#8217;t require any edits of configuration files (fully web-based). Haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but looks like a good candidate for some folks just getting into automated builds and continuous integration.
