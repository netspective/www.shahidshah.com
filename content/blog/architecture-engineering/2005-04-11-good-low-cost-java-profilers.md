One of my clients asked me today about my favorite profilers for performance improvement of Java code. My favorite a few years ago used to be jprobe but these days I&#8217;m using the [YourKit Profiler][1]. It&#8217;s easy to use and has some great memory analysis features (yes, Java has automatic garbage collection but sophisticated apps still have memory issues). Another product I&#8217;d recommend taking a look at is [JProfiler][2].
