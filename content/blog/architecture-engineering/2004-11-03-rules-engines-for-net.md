This morning I was asked about my recommendations for rules engines. On the Java side I&#8217;ve always recommended [Drools][1] or [Jess][2] (though there are many more Java-based open source engines listed on [this site][3]). The .NET rules engines that I&#8217;m aware of include [NxBRE][4], [QuickRules][5], and [InRule][6]. [This thread][7] on ServerSide.com presents a simple rules engine with source code along with a discussion that includes references to other available engines.
