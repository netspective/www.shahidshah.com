&nbsp;I saw an interesting service offering recently. Check [Autoriginate: Intelligent testing made convenient][1]. Here&#8217;s how they describe themselves:

> **HostedQA** is the industry&#8217;s first web-based QA solution. With a focus on making automated testing <u>convenient</u> and ensuring that the resulting test scripts are <u>intelligent</u>, HostedQA is generations ahead of the competition. No longer do you have to settle for automating only the playback of your tests. HostedQA automates the _entire_ automated testing cycle. We&#8217;ll guide you through everything from setting up your databases and application servers to taking simple-to-understand visual screenshots of each step in the test.

&nbsp;

I haven&#8217;t had a chance to play with it yet, but I&#8217;m going to check it out further.
