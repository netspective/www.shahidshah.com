Although we all have mixed feelings about offshoring of our technology jobs, most of the data that&#8217;s available is generally anecdotal. I just ran across [this report][1] from the British Computer Society (BCS) about offshoring of British IT jobs. They not only talk about the problem (losing jobs) but how IT people in Britain can &#8220;upscale&#8221; their skills to remain competitive. Most of the content is just as relevant for us American technologists as it is for the British.
