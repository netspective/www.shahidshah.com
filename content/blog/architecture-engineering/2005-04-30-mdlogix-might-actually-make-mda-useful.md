There&#8217;s been a lot of talk recently about _Model Driven Architecture_ (MDA) being perhaps a silver bullet or at least a potentially great solution for development of complex software. In my travels as a consulting architect to various mid- and large-scale clients I have yet to see MDA put to good commercial use, though. On Friday as part of an NIH project that I&#8217;m helping with, I visited with the folks at [MD Logix][1] where I saw a demonstration of MDA that didn&#8217;t exactly blow me away but certainly made me less skeptical about MDA&#8217;s potential. It&#8217;s worth checking out MD Logix&#8217;s products and research efforts; while they are a small company, I was impressed because their staff is made up of a bunch of really smart guys. I liked their MDA approach to solving health informatics problems and it&#8217;s worth tracking their progress.
