There&#8217;s a lot of talk these days about video podcasts taking off in 2006. And, I certainly agree that hobbyists will take to it like they have with audio blogging/podcasting. Jakob Nielsen recently discussed how video podcasting may be worse than TV from a usability perspective in his _[Talking-Head Video Is Boring Online][1]_ article.

Of course, even if video podcasts won&#8217;t suck and their usability will not be challenging there&#8217;s still the slight problem of business model: will there be enough advertisers interested in small-market (long tail) video blogs? Will a subscription model work? It&#8217;ll be fascinating to watch everyone try and make money on it!
