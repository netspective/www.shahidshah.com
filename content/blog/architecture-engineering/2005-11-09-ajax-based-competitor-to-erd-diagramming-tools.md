Most of us who&#8217;ve lived in the enterprise database space for even a few years know that Embarcadero and Erwin are two powerful ERD diagramming tools. I just ran across this [WWW SQL Designer][1] tool that provides some of the same features in a thin-client AJAX driven web app. Very nifty, especially [the demo][2]. Now when your boss tells you that he has to have a fat client app because thin clients can&#8217;t handle graphics, show him this demo along with Google Maps to prove how wrong he is!
