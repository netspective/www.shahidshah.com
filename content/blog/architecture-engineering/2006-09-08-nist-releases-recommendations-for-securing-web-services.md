NIST [Special Publication 800-95][1] addresses security needs for networks in which automated Web services are being deployed in service-oriented architectures.&nbsp; It&#8217;s only in draft but it covers the basics fairly well. If you&#8217;re doing business with the government and you plan to offer consumable services it&#8217;s worth making sure you follow the recommendations since the NIST requirements will start showing up in RFPs soon.
