My friend Eric Spiegel&#8217;s just finished a nice [article][1] on working with startups. It&#8217;s a great explanation to customers on why they should do it and what some of the challenges are.

> The challenge that early stage firms encounter is that customers don&#8217;t usually understand they need to deal differently with a startup than an established technology vendor. Let&#8217;s be clear what early stage means. A company with 50 employees, a few million in revenue and a version three product is _not_ early stage. A company with a handful of employees and almost no revenue with a version one (or beta) product is most definitely early stage.

> By working with an early stage vendor, you can gain a competitive advantage on your competitors who aren&#8217;t willing to take this risk. You&#8217;ll have first access to thought-leaders and an innovative product. This will enable you to build and fine tune processes and best practices to get the most out of the new product. When your competition finally discovers the vendor, you will be light years ahead in getting the most out of this investment.
